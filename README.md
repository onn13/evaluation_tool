# Evaluation Tool
The Evaluation Tool is originally designed for assessing the coverage of an organizationâ€™s OT security policy* against the mitigations included in MITRE ATT&CK for ICS v13. Therefore, its knowledge base is purely based on MITRE ATT&CK for ICS v13. Based on the findings of such an assessment organizations can seek to enhance their current defensive approach by including relevant countermeasures to supplement their existing policies.

*For context, OT security policy is in this case understood as a collection of the policies defining the countermeasures an organization has implemented or plans to implement for safeguarding its OT environment.
